# MateriaForge

> All-in-one installer for 7th Heaven and Junction VIII on Linux. 

MateriaForge is the successor to [7thDeck](https://github.com/dotaxis/7thDeck) and [8thDeck](https://github.com/dotaxis/8thDeck), automating the installation and setup of [7th Heaven](https://github.com/tsunamods-codes/7th-Heaven) and [Junction VIII](https://github.com/tsunamods-codes/Junction-VIII) on Linux — now wrapped up nicely in a single application!

## Features

- **Automatic 7th Heaven installation**: downloads, configures, and launches 7th Heaven with no manual setup
- **Multi-platform game detection**: supports multiple storefronts out of the box
- **Junction VIII support**: *(planned)* FF8 mod loader support in active development
- **Written in Rust**: fast, reliable, and expandable
